Capabilities is how you define what am application should have access to.

### Restricting HTTP API

You can configure what endpoints your application can access by adding a capabilities section and then defining `allowed-outgoing-url`.

Example:
```toml
[capabilities]
allowed-outgoing-url = ["https://upcloud.com/*"]
```
