## Http Trigger
An HTTP trigger is a way to invoke an application through HTTP requests. It creates a publicly accessible endpoint that responds to web requests.
HTTP triggers are typically used for webhooks, API endpoints, and serverless functions that need to respond to incoming HTTP requests.

Method: The HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, or ALL)
Path: The URL path where the trigger is accessible (e.g., `/api/webhook`)
Full URL: Combines with the deployment domain (e.g., `https://asgdfs55sd4gs.cloud.heim.dev/api/webhook`)

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
HTTP triggers include Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration to control browser-based access:
- Allowed Origins: List of domains permitted to access the endpoint (e.g., `https://upcloud.com`)
- Allowed Headers: HTTP headers that can be included in requests (e.g., `Content-Type`, `Authorization`)

**Example http trigger configuration:**
```toml
[[trigger]]
type = 'http'
path = '/test/api/*'
method = 'GET'
```
This will create a HTTP trigger that will trigger on the HTTP method `GET` and on the path `/test/api/*`. The `*` means is a wildcard which means it will trigger on any path following the initial path of `/test/api/`.

## Cron Trigger

Cron Expression (6-digit representation):
The schedule is defined using five space-separated fields that determine when the trigger fires:

- Second (0-59): Which second of the minute
- Minute (0-59): Which minute of the hour
- Hour (0-23): Which hour of the day  
- Day (1-31): Which day of the month
- Month (1-12): Which month of the year
- Weekday (0-7): Which day of the week (0 and 7 are both Sunday)

**Each field can contain**:
- A specific value (e.g., `5` for "at 5")
- An asterisk `*` meaning "every" (e.g., `` in the minute field means "every minute")
- Ranges (e.g., `1-5`)
- Lists (e.g., `1,3,5`)
- Step values (e.g., `*/15` for "every 15 minutes")

**Common Use Cases:**
- Scheduled reports: Generate and send reports daily, weekly, or monthly
- Data cleanup: Run maintenance tasks at off-peak hours
- Batch processing: Process accumulated data at regular intervals
- Automated backups: Schedule regular data backups
- Periodic checks: Monitor external services or APIs at set times

CRON triggers are ideal for any task that needs to run automatically on a predictable schedule without manual intervention.

**Example cron trigger configuration:**
```toml
[[trigger]]
type = 'cron'
schedule = '0 0/2 * * * *'
```

## Long-Running Trigger
:::caution[Availability]
    Long Running Triggers are currently only available locally, they will be enabled in Heim cloud in a future release.
:::
**Example long-running trigger configuration:**
```toml
[[trigger]]
type = 'long-running'
```
