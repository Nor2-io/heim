The Heim portal is a web-based GUI for Heim.

It comes bundled with Heim, and will become available when you [start the Heim runtime](../getting-started/#start-heim-runtime).

After starting the Heim runtime, you'll find the portal through the address `${server-address}/heim/portal/`. For instance, if you are running a local installation of Heim, and you start it on port 3000, the portal will be available on the address `127.0.0.1:3000/heim/portal`.
