---

A Nor<sup>2</sup> Heim application.toml file is used to define a application in Heim.

The application.toml is required for deploying an application to Heim.

<br/>

---

## contents

The application.toml file defines the attributes of an application. It names the application, sets a component target, defines application triggers, sets values to environment variables used by the application and defines scaling limits.

This example shows a simple application.toml file:

```toml
name = "example-application"
component_target = 'example-application:latest'

[trigger.http]
type = 'http'
path = '/test/api/*'
method = 'All'

[env]
variable1 = "Value for variable1"

[scaling]
region = ['localhost']
max-parallel = 4
max-memory = '512MiB'
max-cpu = 2
timeout = '1h'

[capabilities]
allowed-outgoing-url = ["https://dummyjson.com/*", "https://www.google.com/*"]
```
*An example application application.toml*

<br/>

### name

This is a string identifier for your application.

A properly formatted, valid application name should only contain a combination of letters and digits, ie `a-zA-Z0-9-_`.

<br/>

### component_target

This refers to the target component for your application deployment.

Example value:

`'example-application:latest'`

<br/>

:::caution[beta version]

In the beta version of Heim, an application will be locked to only one component. Therefore, this field has no effect in the Heim beta.

### trigger definitions

The application.toml can contain triggers definitions.

| name       | contents                                                                                                            | required  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------|
| _type_     | trigger type in `string` format, example: `http`                                                                    | **yes**   |
| _path_     | relative path in `string` format, example: `/test/api/` and the path can also include wildcards `*`                 | **yes**   |
| _method_   | method value string â€“ `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`,`HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `TRACE`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `CONNECT` or `All`        | **yes**   |

This is an example trigger definition declaration, for a trigger called "trigger.http":

```toml
[trigger.http]
type = 'http'
path = '/test/api/*'
method = 'All'
```

<br/>

:::caution[beta version]

In the beta version of Heim, only http triggers are supported.

:::

<br/>

### env

The env section contains value assignments for environment variables.

Environment variables are value assignments for any environment variables expected by a component. Environment variables are declared in that component's [configuration file](./../componenttoml/).

All non-optional environment variables for a component have to have a value assigned to them in this section.

This is an example of an env section with two environment variables:

```toml
[env]
VARIABLE_NAME = "VALUE1"
VARIABLE_NAME_TWO = "VALUE""
```

<br/>

### scaling definitions

These sections contain maximum allowed values an application may scale up to. The Heim tool will limit any resource usage beyond what is set here.

Scaling settings may be assigned to a specific region, or have their region setting declared as `'localhost'`. There should be a main scaling setting, denoted as`[scaling]`. This section should contain a list of regions, and default scaling values used for all regions without a specific scaling setup. Additional, region-specific, scaling sections may be added, with headers in the format `[scaling.${region}]`. Any region-specific scaling section should be connected to a region in the main scaling section region list.

| name               | contents                                                                                                        | required |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------|
| _region_           | list of regions in `string` format, example: `["eu-north-1", "eu-west-1"]`                                      | **no**   |
| _max-parallel_     | max-parallel deployments  in positive `integer` format                                                          | **no**   |
| _max-memory_       | max allowed memory usage in string format, denoting number and unit, possible units being `KiB`, `MiB` or `GiB` | **no**   |
| _max-cpu_          | max allowed cpu cores used, in positive `integer` format                                                        | **no**   |
| _timeout_          | timeout for long-running processes in `string` format, denoting number and unit, example: `1h`                  | **no**   |

This is an example of a main scaling section:

```toml
[scaling]
region = ['localhost']
max-parallel = 4
max-memory = '1GiB'
max-cpu = 2
timeout = '1h'
```

This is an example of a region-specific scaling section:

```toml
[scaling.eu-west-1]
max-parallel = 2
max-memory = '500MiB'
max-cpu = 1
timeout = '2h'
```

Note that any region-specific scaling sections should refer to a region in the main scaling section.

<br/>

:::caution[beta version]

In the beta version of Heim, scaling settings are ignored, but will be displayed in the heim portal.

Use `'localhost'` for all scaling setting region fields in the beta version. Additional regions and region-specific scaling section may be added, and will be visible in the Heim portal, but will not be respected by the Heim tool.

:::

<br/>

### capabilities definitions

The capabilities section contains allowed URLs that the application can communicate with.

All URLs can be declared fully or use the `*` wildcard to allow all paths for a specific domain.

This is an example of a capabilities section with two allowed URLs:

```toml

[capabilities]
allowed-outgoing-url = ["https://dummyjson.com/*", "https://www.google.com/*"]
```
