Organization name is used for displaying the organizations name.

The default organization domain is what is assigned to the organization when it's created and what your domain your deployed applications will be accessible under if you haven't set a custom domain.

Custom domain allows you to set your application to listen to a custom domain once it has been verified which is currently only available for paid organizations.
