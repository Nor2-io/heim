Heim is an easy-to-use, lightweight and very fast solution for hosting your applications on a local server, or in the cloud. You'll find that it's quick to get started with, and has a low threshold for working at its best.

However, as easy and user-friendly as Heim is, everyone needs to get started somewhere, and we're sure that people will have questions. For that purpose we've created this documentation.

## Intended audience

This documentation is written for developers who want to to host their applications in Heim.

<br />

## Requirements

This documentation was made under the assumption that readers have some familiarity with writing, building, and deploying code.

`optional` If you are interesting in the underpinnings of Heim, or the origins of the application structure we use, we'd also recommend having a look at our [WebAssembly documentation](#https://docs.wa2.dev/wasm/), before you get started with Heim.

<br />

## Purpose

This documentation is meant as both an introduction to our Heim tools, and a handy reference for when you are more familiar with our tools, but need to familiarize or re-familiarize yourself with features like the Heim CLI.

<br />

## These documents do not delve into the following:

- General WebAssembly specifications and concepts
- Programming concepts
