Configuring where your application is ran can be done by adding a scaling section to your `application.toml`. In this scaling section you then define regions which takes an array or regions that you want to run your application within.
If no scaling section or regions are defined and there only is one region available then it will default to deploying to that region. In the case of a free account this will be `upcloud-se-1` which is the [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com/) Stockholm 1 region.
```toml
[scaling]
regions = ["upcloud-se-1"]
```
